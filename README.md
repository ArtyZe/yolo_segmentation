# yolo_segmentation
the code is to get segmentation image by darknet

In the process of my project, I have referenced nithi89/unet_darknet in some points
and nithilan has give me many important advices, thanks to him, and if you have interest you can visit his homepage.

This is my first version, and now it has not so perfect result, but i think it's good enough for me. I will continue to update afterwards.

If you want to get the cfg file and weight file, please let me know.
