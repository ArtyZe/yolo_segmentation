 *   or 32-bit integer or floating-point data cannot be shared.
 * - Surfaces of depth or stencil formats cannot be shared.
 *
 * A complete list of supported DXGI formats is as follows. For compactness the
 * notation A_{B,C,D} represents A_B, A_C, and A_D.
 * - DXGI_FORMAT_A8_UNORM

/**
 * \brief Gets the pitch of a subresource of a Direct3D resource which has been
 * mapped for access by CUDA
 *
 * \deprecated This function is deprecated as of CUDA 3.0. 
 *
 * Returns in \p *pPitch and \p *pPitchSlice the pitch and Z-slice pitch of
 * the subresource of the mapped Direct3D resource \p pResource, which
 * corresponds to \p subResource. The values set in \p pPitch and
 * \p pPitchSlice may change every time that \p pResource is mapped.
 *
 * The pitch and Z-slice pitch values may be used to compute the location of a
 * sample on a surface as follows.
 *
 * For a 2D surface, the byte offset of the sample at position \b x, \b y from
 * the base pointer of the surface is:
 *
 * \b y * \b pitch + (<b>bytes per pixel</b>) * \b x
 *
 * For a 3D surface, the byte offset of the sample at position \b x, \b y,
 * \b z from the base pointer of the surface is:
 *
 * \b z* \b slicePitch + \b y * \b pitch + (<b>bytes per pixel</b>) * \b x
 *
 * Both parameters \p pPitch and \p pPitchSlice are optional and may be set to
 * NULL.
 *
 * If \p pResource is not of type ::ID3D10Texture1D, ::ID3D10Texture2D, or
 * ::ID3D10Texture3D, or if \p pResource has not been registered for use with
 * CUDA, then ::cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle is returned. If \p pResource was
 * not registered with usage flags ::cudaD3D10RegisterFlagsNone, then
 * ::cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle is returned. If \p pResource is not mapped
 * for access by CUDA then ::cudaErrorUnknown is returned.
 *
 * For usage requirements of the \p subResource parameter see
 * ::cudaD3D10ResourceGetMappedPointer().
 *
 * \param pPitch      - Returned pitch of subresource
