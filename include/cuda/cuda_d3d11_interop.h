 * \brief Register a Direct3D 11 resource for access by CUDA
 * 
 * Registers the Direct3D 11 resource \p pD3DResource for access by CUDA.  
 *
 * If this call is successful, then the application will be able to map and
 * unmap this resource until it is unregistered through
 * ::cudaGraphicsUnregisterResource(). Also on success, this call will increase the
 * internal reference count on \p pD3DResource. This reference count will be
 * decremented when this resource is unregistered through
 * ::cudaGraphicsUnregisterResource().
 *
 * This call potentially has a high-overhead and should not be called every frame
 * in interactive applications.
 *
 * The type of \p pD3DResource must be one of the following.
 *
 * - ::ID3D11Buffer: may be accessed via a device pointer
 * - ::ID3D11Texture1D: individual subresources of the texture may be accessed via arrays
 * - ::ID3D11Texture2D: individual subresources of the texture may be accessed via arrays
 * - ::ID3D11Texture3D: individual subresources of the texture may be accessed via arrays
 *
 * The \p flags argument may be used to specify additional parameters at register
 * time.  The valid values for this parameter are 
 *
 * - ::cudaGraphicsRegisterFlagsNone: Specifies no hints about how this
 *   resource will be used.
 * - ::cudaGraphicsRegisterFlagsSurfaceLoadStore: Specifies that CUDA will
 *   bind this resource to a surface reference.
 * - ::cudaGraphicsRegisterFlagsTextureGather: Specifies that CUDA will perform
 *   texture gather operations on this resource.
 *
 * Not all Direct3D resources of the above types may be used for
 * interoperability with CUDA.  The following are some limitations.
 *
 * - The primary rendertarget may not be registered with CUDA.
 * - Textures which are not of a format which is 1, 2, or 4 channels of 8, 16,
 *   or 32-bit integer or floating-point data cannot be shared.
 * - Surfaces of depth or stencil formats cannot be shared.
 *
 * A complete list of supported DXGI formats is as follows. For compactness the
 * notation A_{B,C,D} represents A_B, A_C, and A_D.
 * - DXGI_FORMAT_A8_UNORM
 * - DXGI_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_UNORM
 * - DXGI_FORMAT_B8G8R8X8_UNORM
 * - DXGI_FORMAT_R16_FLOAT
 * - DXGI_FORMAT_R16G16B16A16_{FLOAT,SINT,SNORM,UINT,UNORM}
 * - DXGI_FORMAT_R16G16_{FLOAT,SINT,SNORM,UINT,UNORM}
 * - DXGI_FORMAT_R16_{SINT,SNORM,UINT,UNORM}
 * - DXGI_FORMAT_R32_FLOAT
 * - DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_{FLOAT,SINT,UINT}
 * - DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32_{FLOAT,SINT,UINT}
 * - DXGI_FORMAT_R32_{SINT,UINT}
 * - DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_{SINT,SNORM,UINT,UNORM,UNORM_SRGB}
 * - DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8_{SINT,SNORM,UINT,UNORM}
 * - DXGI_FORMAT_R8_{SINT,SNORM,UINT,UNORM}
