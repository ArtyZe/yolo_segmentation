 *
 * Returns in \p *pPitch and \p *pPitchSlice the pitch and Z-slice pitch of

 * \p pPitchSlice may change every time that \p pResource is mapped.

 * The pitch and Z-slice pitch values may be used to compute the location of a
 * sample on a surface as follows.
 *
 * For a 2D surface, the byte offset of the sample at position \b x, \b y from
 * the base pointer of the surface is:
 *
 * \b y * \b pitch + (<b>bytes per pixel</b>) * \b x
 *
 * For a 3D surface, the byte offset of the sample at position \b x, \b y,
 * \b z from the base pointer of the surface is:
 *
 * \b z* \b slicePitch + \b y * \b pitch + (<b>bytes per pixel</b>) * \b x
 *
 * Both parameters \p pPitch and \p pPitchSlice are optional and may be set to
 * NULL.
 *
 * If \p pResource is not of type ::IDirect3DBaseTexture9 or one of its
 * sub-types or if \p pResource has not been registered for use with CUDA,
 * then ::cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle is returned. If \p pResource was not
 * registered with usage flags ::cudaD3D9RegisterFlagsNone, then
