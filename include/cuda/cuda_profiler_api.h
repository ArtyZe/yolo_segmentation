/**
 * \brief Initialize the CUDA profiler.
 *
 * Using this API user can initialize the CUDA profiler by specifying
 * the configuration file, output file and output file format. This
 * API is generally used to profile different set of counters by
 * looping the kernel launch. The \p configFile parameter can be used
 * to select profiling options including profiler counters. Refer to
 * the "Compute Command Line Profiler User Guide" for supported
 * profiler options and counters.
 *
 * Limitation: The CUDA profiler cannot be initialized with this API
 * if another profiling tool is already active, as indicated by the
 * ::cudaErrorProfilerDisabled return code.
 *
 * Typical usage of the profiling APIs is as follows: 
 *
 * for each set of counters/options\n
 * {\n
 *      cudaProfilerInitialize(); //Initialize profiling,set the counters/options in 
 * the config file \n
 *      ...\n
 *      cudaProfilerStart(); \n
 *      // code to be profiled \n
 *      cudaProfilerStop();\n
 *      ...\n
 *      cudaProfilerStart(); \n
 *      // code to be profiled \n
 *      cudaProfilerStop();\n
 *      ...\n
 * }\n
 *
 *
 * \param configFile - Name of the config file that lists the counters/options
 * for profiling.
 * \param outputFile - Name of the outputFile where the profiling results will
 * be stored.
 * \param outputMode - outputMode, can be ::cudaKeyValuePair OR ::cudaCSV.
 *
 * \return
 * ::cudaSuccess,
 * ::cudaErrorInvalidValue,
 * ::cudaErrorProfilerDisabled
 * \notefnerr
 *
 * \sa
 * ::cudaProfilerStart,
 * ::cudaProfilerStop,
 * ::cuProfilerInitialize
